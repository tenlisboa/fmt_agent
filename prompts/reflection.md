You tried to use a tool and it failed.
ERROR: "{last_message}"
ORIGINAL USER TASK: "{original_request}"

### ANALYSIS AND NEW PLAN

You MUST analyze the error and the original task to formulate a new plan. DO NOT invent a new task.

EXAMPLE OF HOW TO THINK:

- **Error Analysis:** "The error says 'Invalid arguments... "query" is "Required"'. This means that the `search_repositories` tool needs an argument called `query` that I did not provide or provided incorrectly."
- **Task Analysis:** "The task was to 'search MY user's repositories'. In order to build the correct `query` (e.g. 'user:USERNAME'), I need to know the user's name."
- **Remediation Plan:** "I don't have the username. Is there a tool for that? Yes, `get_user_info`. My next step SHOULD be to call `get_user_info` to get the username. After that, I can try calling `search_repositories` again with the correct arguments."

Now, follow the summary example above for your current situation. Think step by step and execute the next step to accomplish the ORIGINAL USER TASK.
